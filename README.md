# Movie Recommender System
A movie recommender system suggests movies to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarities to other movies.<br><br>
For my project I have used Content-Based Filtering:<br>
Basically this filtering recommends movies based on the attributes of the movies themselves and the user's past preferences. For example, if a user likes action movies, the system will suggest other action movies by analyzing movie genres, actors, and directors.

<h6>Key Components</h6><br>
<ol><li>Item Profiles:</li>
Information about the movies, such as genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries.<br>
<li>Similarity Measures:</li>

Algorithms to compute similarities between users or items. This Project includes cosine similarity.<br>
<li>Recommendation Algorithms:</li>


Example Use Case
Data Collection:

Gather data from users, such as movie ratings, watch history, and demographic information.
Data Processing:

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize ratings, and extract features.
Model Training:

Train recommendation models using historical data to learn user preferences and item characteristics.
Generating Recommendations:

Use the trained model to predict and suggest movies to users based on their profile and similarity measures.
Evaluation:

Assess the performance of the recommender system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the quality of recommendations.
Example Libraries and Tools
Python Libraries: scikit-learn, surprise, implicit, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Data Sources: Movie databases like IMDb, The Movie Database (TMDb), or user-generated datasets like MovieLens
